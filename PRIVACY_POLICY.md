# Privacy Policy for Healthio

**Last Updated: January 30, 2026**

Healthio ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data, specifically regarding health information and file access.

## 1. Data Sovereignty & Storage
Healthio is built on the principle of **Data Sovereignty**.
*   **Local Storage:** Your health data, meal logs, and workout history are stored locally on your device using an encrypted database (Room).
*   **User-Controlled Sync:** You may choose to sync your data to your personal Google Drive account. Healthio uses the restricted `drive.file` scope, meaning it can only access files it creates. It cannot see or access any of your other documents or files.
*   **No Third-Party Servers:** Healthio does not own or operate any servers to store your health or personal data. Your data stays with you.

## 2. Health Connect
Healthio integrates with **Google Health Connect** to provide a unified health dashboard.
*   **Data Accessed:** We read workout sessions, active calories, and weight data to visualize your progress.
*   **Data Written:** Healthio may write weight data to Health Connect if you manually log it within the app and grant permission.
*   **Usage:** This data is only used to display charts and summaries within the App. We do NOT share this data with third parties or advertisers.

## 3. Gemini AI (Google Generative AI)
The "Smart Vision" feature uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze food images.
*   When you take a photo of a meal, the image is sent to Google's Generative AI SDK for analysis.
*   This process is used solely to estimate nutritional value (calories, macros).
*   Images are not stored by Healthio after analysis.

## 4. Permissions
The App requests the following permissions:
*   **Camera:** To scan meals for AI analysis.
*   **Health Connect Permissions:** To sync health data.
*   **Google Account:** To facilitate the Google Sheets sync on your own Drive.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
