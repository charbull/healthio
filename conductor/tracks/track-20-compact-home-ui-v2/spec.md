# Track 20: Compact Home UI v2

**Goal:** Further compact the Home Screen to ensure "Add Meal" buttons are visible without scrolling by removing redundant status text.

## Scope
1.  **Fasting Section Refinement:**
    -   Remove the status text ("READY" / "FASTING TIME") entirely.
    -   The timer value (00:00:00) and the visual ring are sufficient to convey state.
2.  **Visual Polish:**
    -   Reduce vertical padding/spacing further if necessary.

## Success Criteria
-   Home Screen fits on screen with no scrolling.
