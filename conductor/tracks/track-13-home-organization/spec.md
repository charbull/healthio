# Track 13: Home Screen Organization

**Goal:** Reorganize the Home Screen to provide a cleaner, sectioned UI, separating Fasting controls from Energy stats.

## Scope
1.  **Section 1: Fasting Control**
    -   Top section of the screen.
    -   Contains: Flux Timer (Visual), Timer Display (Text), Status Label, and the Primary Action Button ("Start Fast" / "End Fast").
    -   This groups all "Time" related actions together.
2.  **Section 2: Energy Dashboard**
    -   Below the Fasting section.
    -   Contains: The "Today's Energy" card (Intake, Burned, Net).
    -   This groups all "Calories" related info together.
3.  **Visual Separation:**
    -   Use spacing or a divider to clearly separate these two functional areas.
    -   Remove "intertwined" layout where buttons were at the bottom far from the timer.

## Success Criteria
-   Home Screen has two distinct, logical sections.
-   Primary Fasting Action is immediately accessible near the timer.
-   UI looks "cleaner" and less scattered.
