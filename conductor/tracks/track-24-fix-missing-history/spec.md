# Track 24: Fix Missing History Data

**Goal:** Fix the bug where manually added meals and workouts do not appear in the Stats/History screen.

## Scope
1.  **Investigation:**
    -   Verify `StatsUtils` logic with real-world timestamps (e.g., `System.currentTimeMillis()`).
    -   Verify `StatsViewModel`'s observation of Room flows.
2.  **Fix:**
    -   Ensure that the timestamp generated by `AddWorkoutDialog` and `HomeViewModel` falls within the bucket calculated by `StatsUtils` for the "Week" view.
    -   Ensure `StatsScreen` forces a refresh or observes the data correctly.

## Success Criteria
-   Manually added meal appears in Calories/Macros chart immediately.
-   Manually added workout appears in Workouts chart immediately.
