# Track 02: Home Screen UI & Flux Timer

**Goal:** Implement the main dashboard featuring the "Flux Timer" circular progress indicator and establish the app's minimalist visual identity.

## Scope
1.  **State Management:** Create a `HomeViewModel` to manage the timer state (Fasting vs. Eating) and progress.
2.  **Circular Progress Component:** Build a custom Compose component for the Flux Timer.
    -   **Fasting State:** Green ring.
    -   **Eating State:** Orange ring.
3.  **Home Screen Layout:** 
    -   Large central timer.
    -   High-contrast status text.
    -   Toggle button for "Start Fast" / "End Fast".
4.  **Theme Refinement:** Ensure high-contrast dark mode colors are applied.

## Success Criteria
-   Home Screen displays a functional circular progress indicator.
-   Users can toggle between "FASTING" and "EATING" states.
-   UI matches the "Minimalist, high-contrast" vibe.
