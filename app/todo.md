* change the font of healthio
* add calories burned since people burn calories even when not logged
* When the sync is done make sure to set the data in the DB to isSynched
* show the number of exercices per week, month, year
* dont add the food directly to the log as the user might be just checking the calories
* allow the user to enter a meal with calories
* Notifications, if the user is not fasting, ask them to log meal or workout remind them around lunch time. With time we can maybe check when they are logging and ask them around the same time of day
* split the view to have fasting and then the energy and workout and then food intake
