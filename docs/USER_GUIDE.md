## ⚙️ 1. First-Time Setup (Crucial)

When you first open Healthio, head straight to the **Settings** (gear icon in the top right) to configure your baseline.

### **General Settings**
*   **Weight Unit:** Choose between **kg** or **lbs**. This will update the entire app, including your historical charts.

### **AI Configuration**
*   **Gemini API Key:** Healthio uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze your meals. 
    1. Click the link in settings to go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    2. Create a free API Key.
    3. Paste it into the "Gemini API Key" field.
    *This allows for instant, private food analysis without a subscription.*

### **Backup & Sync**
*   **Connect Google Drive:** Tap to sign in. Healthio uses a "Restricted Scope," meaning it **only** has access to the folders it creates. This ensures your private data stays on your personal Google Drive.

### **Nutrition Goals**
*   **Base Daily Burn (BMR):** Enter the calories you burn naturally (at rest). 
*   **Macros:** Set your daily Carbs and Fat goals.
*   **Protein:** Choose "Fixed" or "Based on Body Weight" (e.g., 1.5g per kg/lb).

*   **Manual Entry:** Forgot to hit the button? Tap the "Manual Entry" link below the timer to log a past fast.

### **B. Macro Widget (Middle)**
*   Visualize your progress toward your protein, carb, and fat goals.
*   **Colors Matter:** Bars turn **Green** when you hit your goal and **Red** if you exceed your carb limit.

### **C. Energy & Weight (Bottom)**
