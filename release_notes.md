# Release Notes - v1.0.8

## v1.0.8 - AI Robustness & Developer Experience (2026-02-05)

### 🤖 Smart Vision Improvements
*   **Robust AI Parsing:** Fixed a crash where the AI would return decimal values (e.g., "0.5g protein") instead of whole numbers. The parser now gracefully handles floating-point numbers from the Gemini model.
*   **Precision Prompting:** Updated the AI engine to prioritize whole-number estimates for better consistency across the app.

### 🛠️ Developer Tools
*   **Debug Support:** Configured the local environment to support seamless Google Drive connectivity during emulator testing.
